# DL-Group-assignment-2

For the first part of the assignement we use dataset from one of the recommended parts about the gifs.
We decide to only use a part of the dataset to create our Semantic search engine due to the length of time it would take to load in the model encoding. The final database only consist the first 10.000 gifs from the dataset.
The end result is semantic search engine that shows use the three most similar gifs based on a text input.

For the second part we work with Stochastic Gradient Descent and Attention Mechanism.
We manually execute the process of updating weights for two examples using Stochastic Gradient Descent. We document each step, including input calculation, prediction, loss assessment, weight adjustments, and updates in great details. 
We use the data for Swedish car insurance to perform the Stochastic Gradient Descent.
For the Attention Mechanism part we implememnt the attention mechanism on two distinct sentences. We choose sentences with polysemous words to demonstrate its functionality effectively.
